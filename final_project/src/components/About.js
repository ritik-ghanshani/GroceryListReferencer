                        Initially conceived as a part of a class project, this
                        multi-billion dollar worthy Grocery List website was
                        developed by 5 young minds in a span of 5 weeks.

                        <br />
                        This application's main appeal is the ease of managing
                        Grocery Lists and checking if the desired item is in
                        stock at the store.

                        <br />
                        We currently support the following features:
